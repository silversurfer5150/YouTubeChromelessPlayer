YouTubeChromelessPlayer
=======================

A Re-Skinable YouTube Player Based On The YouTube Chromeless JavaScript API

NOTES:


1. IMPORTANT! You must have these files on a live server in order to communicate with YouTube's Javascript API, they do not allow you to call up their player object locally.

2. Due to restrictions imposed by Adobe inside of Flash itself, it isn't possible to implement the FULLSCREEN function into this plugin. The newer browsers don't support a javascript fullscreen function consistently and the only other way to do it is to create an ActionScript wrapper around the player. If you have the time to do this, I would love to see this done. I hope that you enjoy my player and I welcome any constructive feedback.

Best regards
